Going beyond refugee registration

THE Government should not place too much confidence in its own statistics 
regarding the number of Venezuelan refugees in this country.
From the beginning it has not had a handle on this issue, preferring to leave it 
to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, Living Water and sundry 
private groups and individuals.
The Chief Immigration Officer should also resist the temptation to be definitive 
in her assessment, given the number of Venezuelan refugees who have been able to 
bypass the immigration system by landing in various coastal backdoors of south 
Trinidad. While the number escalated sharply in January when Juan Guaid√≥ 
declared himself president, Venezuelan refugees have been arriving here 
illegally by the boatload for the past two years.
Let us not forget it was back in 2016 that the Trinidad and Tobago Government 
facilitated shipments of food and pharmaceuticals to Venezuela as its economy 
went into a nosedive. Notwithstanding this, however, the registration exercise 
now underway is a definite step in the right direction, late as it is. The fact 
that long lines of illegal migrants have come out of the shadows to enter the 
regularisation process underscores their interest in doing the right thing, even 
if desperation pushed them into illegal entry.
At the end of the two-week process, the Government should publicly disclose how 
many persons have registered, even if that figure is to be taken with a big 
grain of salt.
Hopefully, in giving registered Venezuelans the right to work here for a year, 
the T&T Government is also giving itself the chance to develop a more coherent 
response to the refugee crisis. Many Venezuelans have already made it known that 
they would willingly return home if the current crisis is resolved. For them, 
Trinidad is a temporary place of refuge.
