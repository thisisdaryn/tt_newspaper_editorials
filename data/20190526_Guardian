The growing lawlessness

The rev­e­la­tion in to­day’s Sun­day Busi­ness Guardian of two in­ci­dents in which 
en­er­gy re­lat­ed in­stal­la­tions have been shot at, is wor­ry­ing and speaks to the 
grow­ing law­less­ness in the coun­try.
On Thurs­day gun­men shot at the fa­cil­i­ties of Trinidad Off­shore Fab­ri­ca­tors 
Com­pa­ny Lim­it­ed at the LABID­CO in­dus­tri­al es­tate in La Brea, in what po­lice 
sus­pect was an at­tempt to in­tim­i­date the com­pa­ny to hire ad­di­tion­al peo­ple.
This fol­lowed close­ly on the heels of an­oth­er re­port­ed shoot­ing in­ci­dent, this 
time at the con­struc­tion site of Caribbean Gas Chem­i­cals Lim­it­ed, La Brea.
Mit­subishi Heavy In­dus­tries which is the lead con­trac­tor on the project was 
forced to send home all its work­ers on the overnight shift.
The two in­ci­dents took place on the LABID­CO and Union In­dus­tri­al Es­tates. Both 
are man­aged by Na­tion­al En­er­gy, a state com­pa­ny that is part of the NGC group of com­pa­nies.
That gun­men could so eas­i­ly shoot at en­er­gy in­fra­struc­ture and not even be 
chal­lenged is a re­flec­tion of the lev­el of crim­i­nal­i­ty in the coun­try and the 
lack of readi­ness of Na­tion­al En­er­gy to pro­tect the es­tate.
In re­sponse to a num­ber of ques­tions from Guardian Me­dia, the com­pa­ny claimed 
that it had no re­ports of any shoot­ing at its in­dus­tri­al es­tates.
"Na­tion­al En­er­gy has re­ceived no re­ports of shoot­ing on ei­ther the Union or the 
La Brea In­dus­tri­al Es­tate."
But cu­ri­ous­ly it is now in­ves­ti­gat­ing things that sound­ed like gun­shots.
Na­tion­al En­er­gy said, "How­ev­er, the com­pa­ny is cur­rent­ly in­ves­ti­gat­ing a re­port 
of (what sound­ed like) gun shots last evening on the La Brea In­dus­tri­al Es­tate. 
These re­ports are cur­rent­ly be­ing in­ves­ti­gat­ed by Na­tion­al En­er­gy and the TTPS, 
and Na­tion­al En­er­gy has height­ened its se­cu­ri­ty."
Na­tion­al En­er­gy told Guardian Me­dia that it was com­mit­ted to en­sur­ing the safe­ty 
and se­cu­ri­ty of all its ten­ants with­in its es­tate and con­tin­ued to work with 
ten­ants and ‘re­mind them of the need to im­ple­ment ef­fec­tive se­cu­ri­ty mea­sures 
against ill in­tent’.
The com­pa­ny al­so not­ed it had hired Colonel George Robin­son to ad­vise on 
se­cu­ri­ty man­age­ment.
The coun­try’s en­er­gy in­fra­struc­ture is too im­por­tant and must be pro­tect­ed 
against all com­ers. This is, af­ter all, the eco­nom­ic lifeblood of the coun­try. 
For thugs to feel so em­bold­ened that they can on two oc­ca­sions in a week shoot 
at fa­cil­i­ties man­aged by Na­tion­al En­er­gy speaks vol­umes to the lack of 
pre­pared­ness of Na­tion­al En­er­gy and the con­fi­dence of the per­pe­tra­tors.
It is al­so wor­ry­ing that this in­ci­dent takes place in La Brea, a com­mu­ni­ty with 
a rich lega­cy in the oil and gas busi­ness and one which, like many oth­er hosts 
com­mu­ni­ties, have not got­ten their com­men­su­rate op­por­tu­ni­ties with the 
chal­lenges they face in be­ing a host com­mu­ni­ty.
How­ev­er, as we saw be­fore with the take-your-rig-and-go com­ment, try­ing to shake 
down a com­pa­ny or act­ing in a way that is in­im­i­cal to your own in­ter­est leads to 
a loss of in­vest­ment and op­por­tu­ni­ty.
